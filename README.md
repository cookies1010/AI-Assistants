# AI-Assistants
These are some AI-Assistants.

1. AI-Assistant 1.py is based on Neuralnine's Virtual Voice Assistant, but it is more useful. The AI-Assistant 1.py file comes with an intents.json file which is used to tell the assistant to map a sentence to a function. You can create notes and create to dos which Neuralnine did, but now you can play videos on youtube. Also you can google search hands-free.
